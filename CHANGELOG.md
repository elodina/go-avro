# Changelog

#### Version 0.3 (not yet released)

API Changes:

 - DataFileReader gets some major updates:

   - No longer need to pass a Decoder, though one is accepted for source compat reasons.
   - Can now decode 'deflate' codec files.
   - Does not read the entire file into memory, for large files and streaming.

#### Version 0.2 (2017-12-16)

Intention: start making changes towards a 1.0 release.

API Changes:
 - The `BinaryEncoder` type is now a private type. `avro.NewBinaryEncoder()`
   now returns a value of the `Encoder` interface.
 - Decoder changes:

   - The `BinaryDecoder` type is now also a private type. `avro.NewBinaryDecoder()`
     now returns a value of the `Decoder` interface.
   - Removed `ReadFixedWithBounds`, removed the use case which dictated it.
   - Removed `Seek`, and removed seeking from DataFileReader.
   - Add an implementation of BinaryDecoder which can work on an io.Reader

 - Rename the `Writer` and `Reader` interfaces to `Marshaler` and `Unmarshaler` to
   be more like the JSON encoder and also use similar method names.
 - Rename error types `FooBar` to be `ErrFooBar`

Improvements:
 - Major improvement to docs and docs coverage
 - Add a singular `NewDatumWriter` which will become the replacement for the generic/specific types.
